# Snow Emergency ETL Project
Each winter The City of Minneapolis collects information on Snow Emergencies across the state. The city has made this data public using their Open data platform at [Link](http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets?t=Snow%20Emergency).
For this project, we focused on Snow Emergency data from 2018. 
In total, there were 3 Snow Emergencies in 2018. Those were named - Howe, Xerxes and Yardville.
The dataset contains two files for snow emergency - Tags(which are citations) and Tows(which are towings).
